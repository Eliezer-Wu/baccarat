I will give a brief report on the recent accomplishments of our Macro team here at the Taipei office. Over the past few months, our team has been diligently working on two tasks, first is to creat a comprehensive handbook of our existing macros, second is to create new macros to support our daily works.
In the past, our colleagues have created numerous macros intended to serve as powerful tools for our programmers. However, due to several reasons, some of these macros have become outdated or not using by our Statistical Programmers due to lacking of documentation.
To address this issue, the Macro team has dedicated considerable effort to comprehensively document our existing macros. This includes detailing the purpose and syntax of each macro, making it easier for SPs to understand and utilize them effectively.
Furthermore, we've developed several new macros to provide our programmers with efficient tools to streamline their workflow processes.
For instance, Charly and I have developed two new macros: one for generating change from baseline tables and another for shift tables. These are two common tables required by almost every trials. These macros have undergone testing using real research data, including the complex and messy SL-1002 function test data.
Our macros have consistently delivered outstanding results in producing shift tables. Thus we are confident that our new macros have sufficient flexibility and adaptability in handling diverse data and research scenarios, enabling our SPs to work more efficiently.
In closing, I want to express my gratitude to all members of the Macro team – Charly, Jeffrey, Li-Ying, Yu-Chuan, and Jasmine – for their dedication and hard work, thank you for the contributions, and that's all fot the macro team.
